## Welcome to Pipeseroni!

We make gorgeous terminal screensavers, the most well known of which is
[pipes.sh][]. We also have a few other programs which are either versions in
different languages or idea which build on the core pipes concept. Enjoy!

### A Brief History

pipes.sh was originally created by [Matthew Simpson][]  and posted to the [Arch
Linux Forums][] in early 2010. It was also later posted to [Gist][GistMS]
released in the public domain.

In early 2013 [Yu-Jie Lin] posted a modification of the script to
[Gist][GistYJL] after reading about it on a [blog][]. It was maintained on Gist
independently for a period of a few months.

In 2014 the script was given its own GitHub repo which encouraged contributions
from other developers. As the script gained more popularity the decision was
made to combine forces with developers of similar projects (such as this [C
version][pipes.c]).

Finally, in 2015 the MIT license was added and the [Pipeseroni][] collective
was formed. Matthew and Yu-Jie have since left the project and it is now
maintained by [Joshua Fogg][] and [Stefans Mezulis][].
